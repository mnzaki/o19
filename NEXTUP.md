- app starter script
  - clone o19 itself then run this script to create your own monorepo
  - the new monorepo is configured to also see the packages in o19
    - so when you develop, if there's code that goes into o19 just add it there
      and push a branch to your clone
      - so let's make it easy to link your o19 clone to your fork

# DONE and committed
