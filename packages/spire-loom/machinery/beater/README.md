# The Beater ⚒️

> *"After the shuttle passes, the weft must be packed tight."*

The [beater](../) is the part of the loom that packs each row of weft tight against the previous. In code generation, this means **formatting**—making sure what's woven stays clean, consistent, and tight.

## What the Beater Does

- Runs prettier on TypeScript/JavaScript
- Runs rustfmt on Rust code
- Ensures consistent style across generated files
- Validates that generated code is well-formed

## Why Beating Matters

Loose weft creates weak fabric. Unformatted code creates technical debt. The beater ensures that what the [shuttle](../shuttle/) weaves will endure.
