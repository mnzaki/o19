> Infrastructure disguised as a diary, built on infrastructure disguised as git.

- The CCCB — accumulation before commitment
- TheStream™ — experience, not creation; seen, not made
- PKB — $HOME/pkb/ as habitat, not hierarchy
- Never force, only guide
- Local-first, hash-first, sign-first
- Content-addressed: `type://id#fragment`
- Radicle — not sync, but rhizome
- `.js.md` — data that reads

> One should not lose sight of oneself when adding to oneself.
